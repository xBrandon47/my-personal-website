        <h4> Located</h4>
        <p>For the moment I'm located on planet Earth. You can find me here 39.7392° N, 104.9903° W. This location is my favorite because I get to experience Earth's different seasons daily. For example, today the sun can be blistering and the next day can be icy-cold just depending how Colorado feels.

        <h5>About Me</h5>
        <p>I came to Earth around 11:47 pm on Octuber 15, 1999. Since I came to Earth one of my favorite things to do is to look for pizza-pie places. I love all kinds of pies Neapolitan, Sicilian, New-York-Style, and New Haven style. Blue Pan right now has the best Detroit-Style pie. Pies and I have build a unbreakable relationship so, you will always catch in Uptown with some sort of pie </p>
