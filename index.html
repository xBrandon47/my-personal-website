        <h4> Located</h4>
        <p>For the moment I'm located on planet Earth. You can find me here 39.7392° N, 104.9903° W. This location is my favorite because I get to experience Earth's different seasons daily. For example, today the sun can be blistering and the next day can be icy-cold just depending how Colorado feels.
